d 'FRE': module to display one-way frequency table
d 
d   fre displays, for each specified variable, a univariate
d frequency table containing counts, percent, and cumulative
d percent. Variables may be string or numeric. Labels, in full
d length, and values are printed. By default, fre only tabulates
d the smallest and largest 10 values (along with all missing
d values), but this can be changed. Furthermore,  values with zero
d observed frequency may be included in the  tables. The default
d for fre is to display the frequency  tables in the results
d window. Alternatively, the tables may be written to a file on
d disk, either tab-delimited or  LaTeX-formatted.
